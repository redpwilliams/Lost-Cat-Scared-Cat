# Lost Cat Scared Cat

Endless runner game created with Unity. Developed on Unity **2021.3.11f1 Personal**.

## Concept

Play as a lost and scared cat stranded in a forest escaping an endless onslaught of foxes that run, jump, and dash toward you. In this infinite side scroller, navigate and evade the foxes that chase you in an effort to escape the forest. Can you outrun them all?
