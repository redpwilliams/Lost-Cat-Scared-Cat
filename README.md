# Lost Cat Scared Cat

Endless runner game created with Unity. Developed on Unity **2021.3.11f1 Personal**.

## Concept

Play as a lost and scared cat stranded in a forest escaping an endless onslaught of foxes that run, jump, and dash toward you. In this infinite side-scroller, navigate and evade the foxes that chase you in an effort to escape the forest. Can you outrun them all?
